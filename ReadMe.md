There are two output files: 
one with the code blocks ```BenRosenberg-FRB-WorkSample.pdf```, 
and one without them ```BenRosenberg-FRB-WorkSample-NOCODE.pdf```.

The data file ```prime-age.csv``` is a subset of the complete 2023 Monthly CPS dataset. In order to use other variables or otherwise regenerate ```prime-age.csv```, simply download the monthly .csv files [from the Census Bureau site](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.2023.html) and place them in the ```CPS-Microdata``` folder.

All pdf output is generated using vanilla RMarkdown and ggplot.
